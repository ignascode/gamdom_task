**React Assignment: Movie Search App**

**_Instructions_**
Your task is to create a movie search application using React. The application should allow users to search for movies, filter the search results, and view detailed information about each movie.

**_Requirements_**
You can use the below technologies as part of the solution

- TypeScript (Avoid `any` types as much as possible thereby enforcing a strictly typed behaviour)
- StyledComponents (You can use styled-components as your CSS solution but feel free to use any other solution you're comfortable with)
- Mobx (for state management - if you don't have prior experience with Mobx, you can use any other state management you're comfortable with)

**_Features_**

- Implement a search functionality that allows users to enter a movie title and retrieve a list of matching movies from an API. You can use the OMDb API or any other movie database API of your choice.
- Display the search results as a list of movie cards showing the movie title, poster image, and release year.
- Include a dropdown filter to allow users to filter the search results by movie type (e.g., movie, series, episode). The filter should update the search results dynamically based on the selected movie type.
- Implement a feature that allows users to click on a movie card to view more detailed information about the selected movie. Retrieve additional movie details from the API and display them on a separate page or modal. Show information such as the movie title, poster image, plot, cast, and any other relevant details.
- Add a feature that allows users to save movies to a favorites list. The favorites list should be persistent and stored in the browser's local storage. Include an option to remove movies from the favorites list.
- Implement error handling for failed API requests or any other errors that may occur during the application's usage. Display appropriate error messages to the user.

**_Additional Requirements_**

- Use React hooks, including useState, useEffect, and any other relevant hooks for managing state and side effects.
- Use modern ES6 syntax and features, such as arrow functions, destructuring, and async/await.
- Implement reusable components for the movie list, movie card, filter dropdown, and any other UI components you deem necessary.
- Apply CSS or use a CSS framework for styling the application.
- Write clean and maintainable code with proper comments and indentation.
  Optimize the application for performance and consider handling edge cases.

**_Bonus (Optional)_**
If you want to challenge yourself further, you can add the following additional features:

- Pagination for search results to handle large result sets.
- Implement additional filters, such as filtering by year, genre, or rating.
- Implement sorting options for the search results.

**_Submission_**
Please provide a zip file containing your solution. The zip file should include all the necessary files, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Make sure to include any instructions on how to run your solution, if necessary.
